### Overview

* Read levels from Potentiometer to serial
* Convert from potentiometer to LED brightness
* Discuss temparature sensing
* Collexion Visit!

### TODO

* Assign teacher
* Preperation: Make sure the space is cooled, demos are ready
* Sketch: read potentiometer levels in a loop and print serial
* Sketch: set LED brightness from pot input
* Schematics: Potentiometer input
* Schematics: LED on PWM in parallel with pot input
* Demo: print something on makerbot
* Demo: draw something with CNC
* Demo: temperature sensor
* Demo: lightbar

### Read levesl from pot, display via serial

* Breadboard a knob
* Build & run the sketch
* See what min & max values are, discuss binary numbers again
* Everyone gets a sticker!

### Convert from a potentiometer to LED brightness

* Breadboard the LED
* convert from x/1024 to x/256 for PWM
* Run the sketch
* Everyone gets a sticker

### Temperature sensing theory

* measuring voltage differences
* there are now IC to do this as well

### Collexion Visit!

* Arduino bits: LED strip lights, temperature sensing
* Other bits: CNC, 3d printing, entry system
