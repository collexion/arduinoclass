### Overview

* Pulsing notification light
* Design a glowing mood orb
* Outtro: Bleeps & Bloops

### TODO

* Assign teacher
* Slides: Explain PWM
* Slides: Explain number systems (binary vs decimal)
* Sketch: 3-state PWM (20% intensity, 50% intensity, 100% intensity)
* Sketch: Color Fading for tri-color LED
* Sketch: Making a series of beeps at different lengths and pitches
* Schematics: LED on PWM pin
* Schematics: Tri-color LED on many PWM pins
* Schematics: Piezo speaker on PWM pin

### Pulsing notification light

* Breadboard an LED to a PWM port on Arduino
* Output PWM in three states: off, medium, bright
* Everyone gets a sticker!
* Sidebar: number systems -- why is 100% bright = 255 on the PWM scale?

### Design a glowing mood orb

* How 3-color LEDs work
* Breadboard a 3-color LED
* Fade between colors
* Everyone gets a sticker!
* Fade bettwen colors, and at each transition dim & brighten
* Everyone gets two stickers!

### Outtro: Bleeps & Bloops

* Wire up a piezo speaker
* Make some noise at different pitches
* Play Marry Had a Little Lamb
* Everyone who can give the teachers a headache gets a sticker!
