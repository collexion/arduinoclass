### Overview

* History of Arduino (microcontrollers, open hardware, open source)
* Arduino documentary
* Powering the boards
* Blink example
* Introduction to electronic schematics
* Outtro: Breadboarding, offboard blink

### TODO

* Assign teacher
* Preperation: Acquire and test projector or television for documentary
* Slides: history of Arduino, cool arduino projects
* Slides: powering the board, identifying and explaining jumpers
* Slides: breadboarding tutorial
* Slides: steps for deploying sketch
* Sketch: Blink example
* Sketch: Blink on pin 12
* Sketch: Alternate blinks between pins 12 and 13
* Schematics: Fritzing diagram for LED blink, traditional schematic of same
* Further Reading: schematics, arduino projects and blogs, beyond breadboards
* Open Question: how much do we talk about programming / c language?

### History of Arduino
* 1993: Atmel introduces programmable micros, 1996: 8-bit versions
* 2001: Processing (MIT)
* 2003: Wiring (Ivrea)
* 2005: Arduino (Ivrea)
* Common theme of art and interaction
* Show the coolest Arduino projects ever

### Documentary

### Powering the boards
* can be wall wort or USB
* power regulator can get hot
* jumpers for selecting power source

### Blink Example
* launch the IDE
* load the sample
* brief code walkthrough
* select board type
* reset the baord
* compile & run
* debug any issues
* everyone gets a sticker!

### Electronic Schematics
* show Fritzing diagram for offboard blink on pin 13
* wires, LED component identification

### Breadboarding, offboard blink
* How breadboards are divided (power rails, rows of connected sockets)
* Wire the blink example
* Try a pin other than 13, change the code
* Try alternating pins (12, 13, 14, repeat)
* Everyone gets a sticker!
